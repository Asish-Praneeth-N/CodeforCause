    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare all the needed ingredients.

            Pre-heat the oven to 400F. </li>
            <li>Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat and add 1 tbsp of olive oil. When the oil and pan get hot, add 1 cup of chopped red onions and 1/2 cup each of chopped red and orange peppers. Sauté for about 2 mins.  Add 1 large, chopped jalapeño pepper and sauté for another 2 minutes. Then add in 3 large cloves of pressed garlic and sauté for 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Next, add 1 1/2 lbs. of lean ground beef and cook until no longer pink, breaking the beef up into small pieces.

                Halfway through cooking, season the beef with 1 tbsp. chili powder, 1 tbsp. taco seasoning, 1 tsp. ground rosemary, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp. garlic salt. Combine all the ingredients together and cook until the beef is done. </li>
                <li>When done, season the beef mixture with ground Himalayan sea salt and freshly ground black pepper before adding 12 oz of corn kernels. Stir everything until it’s well combined. Add 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes, 10 ounces of cream of tomato soup, and 4 ounces of diced green chilies. Then, add in 1 tbsp of brown sugar, stir, and cook for 2 minutes. Add in ½ cup sharp Cheddar cheese and ½ cup Monterey Jack. Blend all the cheese with the ingredients.

                    When the cheeses are well incorporated, add in 12 oz of cooked al dente egg noodles, stir, and carefully transfer the beef mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the beef mixture and transfer the pan to the preheated oven to bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese is creamy melted. </li>
                    <li>Lastly, carefully remove the dish from the oven and garnish it with 1 1/2 tbsp of finely chopped fresh parsley </li>
    </ol>
